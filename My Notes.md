#Haskell Notes 

## Lists
Lists are like group of arrays of same data type.
[[1,2],[2,4]]
## Tuples
Tuples are like group of arrays which can contain a mix type but group has to contain same number of elements such as 
[(1,2),(3,4),("E","D")]


## General Points
- Everything in Haskell has a type, so the compiler can reason quite a lot about your program before compiling it.
